# digit-recognition
# this is common project you all know about mnist-dataset and many people has done it with very good accuracy.
# but purpose of this project like that way which i did, only want to see what's going on deep neural network in each and every layer, not purpose of getting the good accuracy. 
# i don't use tensorflow and keras any library, i only backpropogate the weights of layer, so i can find what's going on each and every layer.
